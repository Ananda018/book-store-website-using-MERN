The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB for storing book
and user data, Express.js and Node.js for backend development, and React.js for the frontend
interface. For styling, Tailwind CSS was used to create a clean, mobile-friendly layout. The
frontend of the application is deployed using Netlify, while the backend runs on Render,
ensuring the site is available online and functions smoothly.
Users can browse books, search by title or category, and manage their cart. Admin users can
add, update, or delete books from the inventory. This project not only showcases how modern
web technologies can solve real-world problems but also demonstrates the practical application
of full-stack development in building a live, hosted web solution
